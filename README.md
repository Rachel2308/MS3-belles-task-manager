## A Milestone 3 Project by Rachel Sherlock

![The Belles of Three Spires Site Homework Tracker]()

This website was created to promote the barbershop chorus, The Belles of Three Spires. The main purpose of the site is to inform 
people about the Belles, and about barbershop music in general. Users will also be able to contact the Belles through the 
contact form in order to make a booking or to enquire about booking, and also find their location.

Barbershop music is a stripped back style, with no music or embellishments to support the vocals. Due to this it was decided that 
the site should follow a similar ethos, a stripped back site which enables the content to be the main feature. This creates a
site that is clean and easy to navigate.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colours chosen for the site are hot pink and charcoal grey.

The Belles singout outfit consists of a fleece jacket in a similar colour to that used on the site. As the hot pink
is a bright and modern colour, I have paired it with the classic dark grey of the header, footer and text boxes. As well as being 
aesthetically pleasing and easy to read with a good contrast, the combination of modern and classic also mirrors the 
Belles' performance style. The body of the site has a very pale grey/pink background colour. This ties the two main colours together
as well as making the site more comfortable to navigate.   

The charcoal grey of the header and footer is also used throughout the body of the site in text boxes. 

### Typography

There are two main fonts used in the site. Dancing script, with a backup of the cursive font is used for "The Belles of 
Three Spires" and also for the headers. This font matches the font that is used by the Belles on their marketing 
material. All other text uses the lato font, with the backup font of sans serif. This is a clean and easy to read font 
which fits in with the simple style of the site and also contrasts nicely with the script of the headers.

### Imagery

The top images used on the "About the Belles" and "What is Barbershop" pages were chosen as the dark colour scheme stands 
out from the pale background, and the formation of the Belles chorus, along with their open arms makes them look warm 
and welcoming. On the "Contact Us" page, I chose a friendlier, less formal looking image in order to match the 
singouts that they perform. 


### Wireframes

The wireframes for the site were created in balsamiq and uploaded as a pdf. They can be found as a pdf file [here.](documentation/belles-wireframe.pdf)

## Features

### Existing Features

The site is responsive across all screen sizes. The layout of the pages change depending on the size of screen, with some features 
disappearing in smaller screen sizes. This has created a tidy and clean look on all screens.

### 1. Featured timeline

The timeline allows users to engage with the site, enabling them to see the Belle's history and accolades

![Belles' Timeline](documentation/screenshot-belles-timeline.PNG)

### 2. About the Belles

The about the Belles section will give important information about the Belles, building on the timeline and helping the 
user engage with the site.

![About the Belles](documentation/screenshot-about-belles.PNG)

### 3. YouTube Video

The inclusion of a YouTube video enables the user to see the Belles performances. The embedded video means the user 
will stay on the site for longer. This serves 2 purposes, firstly it is beneficial for the site's SEO, and also 
having the video on the page means that the user is more likely to continue to engage with the site rather than 
looking at other YouTube videos.

The embedded video did not work as well on smaller screens, so I made the decision to change the video to a link 
to optimise the user experience.

### 4. Accordion

I have added an accordion in order to give details of the different parts of a barbershop chorus. This helps to 
explain this little known musical style and creates interest.

Having the information given as an accordion means that people will interact more with the site, and also saves
screen space which helps user experience on smaller screens.

### 5. Gallery

A gallery helps the users get to know the Belles and will make them more likely to book them or want to join. It will 
also help to keep the user on the site for longer, increasing SEO. 

The gallery changes depending on screen size, with 3 columns on large screen, 2 on medium and a single column on 
the smaller screen sizes. On hover, the images increase in size, making the page more interactive.

### 6. Contact form

The contact form allows users to make contact with the Belles, and they can also specify the reason for their contact 
in the dropdown box. 

The contact form is optimised for screen size with the percentage width increasing as the screen size decreases. 

![Contact Form](documentation/screenshot-contact-form.PNG)

### 7. Google Maps Embedded Maps

As well as including an address for the Belles, I have also included an embedded map. On mobile I have changed this 
to a link to Google Maps as the embedded map did not work well on smaller screens.

![Google Maps](documentation/screenshop-map.PNG)

### 8. Social Media Links

Including the links to the Belles' social media pages increases the user engagement with the chorus and allows them
to keep up to date with their news.

### Features Left To Implement

### 1. Reviews

A review section could help to increase booking enquiries for the chorus.

### 2. Sticky Navbar

The addition of a sticky navbar would help to make the site more user friendly.


### 3. Calendar

Including a calendar of the Belle's performances will help to increase attendance, and subsequently help to 
increase future bookings.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

* **User Stories** 
    * **First Time User Goals**
        1. As a first time user, I will want to know about the Belles and their history.
            * On opening the site, the first thing that the user will see is the Belles' timeline giving key information 
            since their start date. The "About the Belles" section also gives more detailed information.
            
            ![](documentation/screenshot-home-page.PNG)

        2. As a first time user, I may not know about the barbershop style and will want to learn more.
            * The "What is Barbershop" page gives information about the barbershop style, and the accordion explains 
            the different parts of a barbershop chorus. 

            ![](documentation/screenshot-barbershop.PNG)

        3. As a first time user, I will want to look them up on social media to get to know more about them.
            * Links in the footer contain links to the Belles facebook page, twitter, instagram and YouTube videos. 
            This enables the user to easily access these sites. 

            ![](documentation/screenshot-social-media.PNG)

    * **Returning User Goals**
        1. As a returning user, I will want to keep updated with what the Belles are doing.
            * The "About the Belles" section will be kept up to date with current information, and entries will be 
            added to the timeline as is necessary.
        2. As a returning user, I may want to contact the Belles.
            * The contact form will enable users to contact the Belles with any enquiries that they have.
    
            ![](documentation/screenshot-contact-form.PNG)

    * **Frequent User Goals**
        1. As a frequent user, I will want to find out where the Belles are located in order to visit.
            * The "Contact Us" page contains the address of the Belles' venue, as well as either an interactive map, or
            the link to Google maps on smaller screen sizes. 

            ![](documentation/screenshop-map.PNG)

        2. As a frequent user, I will want to listen to them and see their latest performances.
            * The embedded YouTube video on the homepage enables users to see the Belles' latest performance, and the 
            link in the footer to the Belles' YouTube channel will enable users to see videos of all their performances.

            ![](documentation/screenshot-youtube.PNG)

### Further Testing

* The Website was tested on:
    * Google Chrome 
    * Internet Explorer 
    * Microsoft Edge 
    * Firefox 
    * Safari 

* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as 
   * Laptop 
   * iPhone7 
   * iPhone 11 
   * iPhoneX
   * Oppo A9
   * Huawei p20 pro

* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that links worked.
* Friends were asked to review the site on different devices, screenshot any issues and point out any bugs or 
user experience issues.



### Contact Form
1. Form cannot be submitted without a name.
2. Form cannot be submitted if a valid email address is not entered.
3. Text box must be completed for the form to be submitted.
4. When all sections of the form are completed, the form submits correctly. 

### Bugs

* When testing on different phones, it was found that when the links in the header were pressed on an iPhone 7, the 
line did not perform as it does on other devices.
* On Internet Explorer, the placeholder text inside the contact form is a little low in the text box.
* On iPhone 11 Pro Max, when viewed in landscape mode, the header and footer do not cover the full width of the page.
This has not been replicated on any other model.
