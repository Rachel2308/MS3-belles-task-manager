![The Belles of Three Spires Site Homework Tracker]()

This website was designed to create a homework tracker for the Belles of Three Spires Barbershop Chorus. It will enable the Belles' music team to be able to 
set homework for the rest of the chorus, All other members of the choris will be able to see which part of which song they should be prioritising.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colours chosen for the site are hot pink and charcoal grey.

The Belles singout outfit consists of a fleece jacket in a similar colour to that used on the site. As the hot pink
is a bright and modern colour, I have paired it with the classic dark grey of the header, footer and text boxes. This makes the site 
aesthetically pleasing and the good contrast makes the site easy to read. The body of the site has a very pale whitesmoke background colour. This ties the two main colours together
as well as making the site more comfortable to navigate.   

The charcoal grey of the header is also used throughout the body of the site in text boxes. 

### Typography

There are two main fonts used in the site. Niconne, with a backup of the cursive font is used for "The Belles of 
Three Spires" in the header. This font is similar to the font that is used by the Belles on their marketing 
material. All other text uses the lato font, with the backup font of sans serif. This is a clean and easy to read font 
which fits in with the simple style of the site and also contrasts nicely with the script of the headers.


### Wireframes

The wireframes for the site were created in balsamiq and uploaded as a pdf. They can be found as a pdf file [here.](./documentation/Homework-Tracker-Wireframe-pdf.pdf)

### Features Changed from Original Wireframe

### 1. Calendar
Originally I wanted to have a google calendar linked to the front page of the site where the members of the Belles can see any events that are coming up. Once this was enbedded it did not look right for the site
and it is not possible to change the look of the calendar within the page. The colour scheme did not work with the rest of the site and I therefore made the decision to delete this from the site.
